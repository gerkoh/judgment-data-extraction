In the lower court, parties each claimed sole credit for the winnings. The judge in the lower court found that the ticket was purchased by H, and attributed the contributions from the winnings to the home to H. 

On appeal, the CA found that a lottery winning obtained during the marriage was a ""matrimonial asset"", forming part of the matrimonial pool. It did not constitute a ""gift"" or ""inheritance"" as the lottery ticket had to be purchased. 

Rather than looking at the source of funds for the purchase of the ticket, one should consider the intention behind purchasing the ticket. There was a presumption that both spouses contributed equally to assets acquired from the winnings, unless the spouse purchasing the ticket could show that s/he purchased the ticket with a view to only benefitting themselves.

W was on record an employee of X Pte Ltd but had stopped working in 2002. The High Court found that this was a single-income marriage despite W working intermittently for 13 years during the 26-year marriage as what mattered was the qualitative assessment of the roles played by the spouses relative to each other (at [52]-[54]). 

Accordingly, Tan JC applied TNL that the division should tend towards equal division. The HC noted that W's homemaking contributions enabled G to focus on building X Pte Ltd and his other companies. However, he also considered the large asset pool and that X Pte Ltd was responsible for a big part of the enhancement of assets, which was achieved through H's efforts over the years. He also noted that W had provided funds to X Pte Ltd in the initial period. Accordingly, the HC arrived at a ratio of 55:45 in H's favour. ",,,,
